## Timeline
> Only some of the most relevant projects and experiences in each period

### 2022
In 2022, I worked as a coordinator for the Development, QA, and Requirements Analysis teams under Contract 074/2021 for the Software Factory at Codions Tecnologia with the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Rio de Janeiro.

During the same year, I developed the desktop version of the `Cubed Server` using `Electron`, refactored the data collection clients for `Linux` servers (Ubuntu and Debian) using `Golang` and `bash`, and made adjustments to other projects using `PHP` and `NodeJS`.

### 2021
In 2021, I developed a resource monitoring software called `Cubed Server`. I created this project with the goal of monitoring on-premises server infrastructure for clients and partners, as well as workstations (Windows, Linux, and macOS). It provides notifications and metrics regarding CPU usage, RAM memory, HD/SSD, and running processes. The software detects anomalies based on applied rules and notifies the team and/or technical responsible person through chosen channels such as Slack, Discord, Telegram, Email, SMS, etc.

### 2020
In 2020, along with colleagues from [Codions Tecnologia](https://codions.com), we improved the `Bluee Live` system, creating new tools, including desktop applications for audio and video streaming via `IP Multicast`. We sold this solution to a telecommunications company in Amazonas.

### 2019
In 2019, I developed a set of web conferencing solutions called `Bluee Live` (Management Interface for the [BigBlueButton](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) software, with additional tools) and licensed it to SEBRAE-SP. With the onset of the `covid-19` pandemic in early 2020, it started to be used by Faculdade Sebrae and several other public and private organizations.

### 2016-2018
In 2016, I founded [Codions Tecnologia](https://codions.com) to provide development and consulting services. In the same year, we needed to scale a Virtual Learning Environment that we had developed monolithically using `PHP/Laravel`, `MySQL`, and `Memcached`. At that time, I was already studying microservices, so it was the perfect opportunity to put some concepts into practice.

My team and I optimized the entire application, refactored parts of it, and transformed some modules into `microservices` using `NodeJS`. Additionally, we adopted `RabbitMQ` for messaging, replaced `Memcached` with `Redis`, used `MongoDB` for storing JSON documents, adopted `Cloudflare` to manage DNS and CDN configurations for assets. We then provisioned some `VPS` on `DigitalOcean` and used `Docker Swarm` for container orchestration.

In 2017, the infrastructure we had set up on DigitalOcean proved to be limited, so I started studying the `AWS cloud provider` and `Kubernetes`. I configured services such as `AWS EKS`, `AWS S3`, `AWS EBS`, `AWS RDS`, `AWS SQS`, and `AWS Elasticache` and began testing. Together with my team, we migrated the system, and no downtime was reported by the client.

### 2015
In 2015, as a Mid-level Developer, assuming some leadership roles within the team, I started applying `Clean Code` principles and some of the `SOLID` principles. In the same year, there was a need to have portable development environments and eliminate the famous "**It works on my machine!**" issue, which was a recurring problem in the team. That's when I discovered and studied `Vagrant` and virtualization concepts. Being curious and a big fan of `Golang`, I also learned about `Docker` and the concepts of containers and container orchestration.

### 2014
In 2014, I came across `Golang` and was fascinated by the language and all its possibilities. I studied it, worked on study projects, gave talks and workshops at FLISoL and other technology events.

### 2013
In 2013, I needed more autonomy to solve infrastructure problems in the projects I worked on. So, I learned to provision Linux servers (Debian/Ubuntu Server), set up the entire LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) for site and system deployment using `GIT` and `SSH` through bash shell scripting. In the same year, I discovered `NGINX` and learned about Load Balancing concepts. I took my first steps with CI/CD tools like `Jenkins`, `Capistrano`, and `Deployer`.

### 2012
In 2012, I had my first formal job as a Junior Web Programmer. I learned a lot from experienced colleagues and started working with semantic versioning, `GIT`, `GitHub`, and `GitLab`. I got introduced to `Node.JS` and `Express.js`, `PostgreSQL`, and learned about OOP concepts and design patterns such as MVC, Factory Method, Prototype, Adapter, and Decorator. I also explored some PHP frameworks like Zend, CakePHP, and Symphony, as well as development practices like TDD (Test-driven development). In the same year, I received a 100% scholarship through PROUNI and started studying Computer Science at Faculdade Pitágoras, part of the Cogna Educação group.

### 2008-2012
From 2008 to 2012, I worked as a freelancer, developing small websites for local businesses. I used `PHP`, `MySQL`, and deployed them via `FTP` using `FileZilla` on shared hosting. During that time, I also discovered and started using the `WordPress` CMS for some projects.

### 2006-2007
In 2006, when I was 14 years old, I had my first contact with programming. Excited about the endless possibilities, I teamed up with friends and created an event coverage website. My first programming language was `JavaScript`, followed by a brief encounter with `ASP`. However, it was with `PHP` that I truly learned to program.
